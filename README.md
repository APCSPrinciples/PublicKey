# Public Key Cryptography
First, we'll watch [this video on Public Key Encryption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZghMPWGXexs&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfMRZm5DDxco3UdsFegvuB7&index=6). Then we will use code.org's [Public Key Widget](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/eM58hKG7dxjrupZH1Pm91Q) to simulate how public key encryption is used when one person, in this case *Bob* wants to send a secret message to a second persion *Alice* when a third person *Eve* can view the contents of the messages that pass between them. Alice and Bob are two “place holder” names that are often used in explanations of cryptography and computer science. The third character Eve gets her name because she is an *eavesdropper*.
(Eavesdropper is an archaic term for someone who secretly stands under the “eaves”  of a house to listen to private conversations).

Steps to complete this assignment:
----------------------------------
+ Form a group of 3 people
+ Experiment with the [Modulo Clock](https://studio.code.org/s/csp4/stage/7/puzzle/4) until you are all comfortable with modulus
+ Each person should open a browser with the [Public Key Widget](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/eM58hKG7dxjrupZH1Pm91Q) choose their character: Alice, Bob, or Eve
+ Follow the instructions on the screen, each are individual to the character.
+ NOTE: _Alice acts first_ - announcing two numbers publicly. Notice that Bob's first instruction is to wait until he hears Alice announce something.
+ When you finish, read the [Activity Guide - Recap: Public Key Cryptography](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JpOnfsr4wZbEUXvpsN_b520NBt8Py6rSwp-uiDCa-VU/edit) to review what you learned in this activity.

If you have extra time, read the optional [How and Why Does the Public Key Crypto Really Work?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c7UGv3Bc0GD0C1EhgSsXzKvzPRj41DcYpUjH8nK0O2c/edit)
